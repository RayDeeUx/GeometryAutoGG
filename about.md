# AutoGG
A less aggressive approach to level completion comment automation.

Instead of automatically uploading comments to the servers (which can get you banned if you do them too quickly), the comment input box is prefilled with your message and attempt count as soon as you open it.

Most of y'all will still ask for automatic comment uploading anyway, so that setting is available as well.

<cy>***__Note:__*** Percentages on your comments may not show in some cases, especially with your most recent comments. This is 99.999% out of my control, and is something you'll need to take up with a Leaderboard Moderator or other in-game Moderator.</c>
